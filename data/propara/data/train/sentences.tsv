908	1	When water freezes it becomes 10% bigger, or takes up 10% more space.
908	2	As water expands it puts great pressure on the walls of anything containing it, including any rocks which happen to be surrounding it.
908	3	The force of the pressure exerted on the rock surrounding it is enough to wedge the walls of the crack farther apart, thus expanding and deepening the crack.
908	4	Clay expends when wet like ice does.

908	6	Some plants like mosses and lichens are capable of growing without soil on bare rock.
908	7	When they do this their roots penetrate pores and crevices and cause rocks to split apart as the roots force their way down through the rocks.
915	1	Sediment transport is the movement of solid particles (sediment).
915	2	The movement is due to a combination of gravity acting on the sediment, and/or the movement of the fluid in which the sediment is entrained.
915	3	Sediment transport occurs in natural systems where the particles are clastic rocks (sand, gravel, boulders, etc.), mud, or clay.
915	4	The fluid is air, water, or ice.
915	5	And the force of gravity acts to move the particles along the sloping surface on which they are resting.
